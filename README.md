# Anne T. ‚Äì Links Landing Page

Hey there! üëã I‚Äôm Anne, and this is my personal ‚Äúlink in bio‚Äù site‚Äîa simple, central place to find my professional links, socials, and a little about me. Built with Hugo and the Lynx theme, it‚Äôs easy for me to update and (hopefully) easy for you to explore.

## üöÄ Live Site

   cd lynx
   ```

## ‚ú® Theme Toggle Features
This site includes a beautiful, custom theme toggle that enhances the user experience:

### üåì Smart Theme Detection
- **Respects System Preference**: Automatically loads in dark or light mode based on your device settings on first visit
- **One-Click Toggle**: Simple toggle between light and dark themes that overrides system preferences
- **Remembers Choice**: Saves your preference for future visits using localStorage
- **No Flash**: Smooth loading without theme flicker
- **System Override**: Custom toggle completely overrides system dark mode to prevent conflicts

### üé® Interactive Design
- **Light Mode**: 
  - Clean original Lynx theme styling
  - Moon icon with purple fill preview on hover

## Custom Dark Theme Enhancements
I've added several modern UI enhancements to create a cohesive dark theme experience:

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
These customizations are implemented in:
- `assets/css/custom.css` - Main theme customizations and toggle styling
- `static/js/theme-toggle.js` - Theme toggle functionality and logic
- `layouts/partials/extend-head.html` - Mobile viewport optimizations and script loading
- `static/site.webmanifest` - Theme color configurations

### üîß Technical Features
